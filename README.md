# E-commerce_Sales_Performance_Project
This project analyzes an Ecommerce Sales Dataset using MySQL for data cleaning and transformation, and Tableau Public for data visualization and dashboard creation. The goal was to uncover sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior across multiple countries between 2022â€“2025.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning (MySQL):
Cleaned and transformed raw data â€” handled missing values, trimmed spaces, standardized text, created calculated fields (SALES, ORDER_MONTH), and excluded cancelled/returned orders.

ðŸ“Š Visualization (Tableau Public):
Built three dashboards:
Sales Overview, Product Overview, and Customer Overview â€” showing trends in sales, top products, and customer behavior.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:

Highest sales from USA and Brazil

Electronics and Home&Kitchen were top-performing categories

Highest sales were recorded between June and August 2024, indicating a strong mid-year sales peak across all three years.
